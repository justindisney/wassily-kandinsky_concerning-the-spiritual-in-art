					<p>Religion, in the sense of awe, is present in all true art. But here I use the term in the narrower sense to mean pictures of which the subject is connected with Christian or other worship.<a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>I am well aware that this statement is at variance with Kandinsky, who has contributed a long article—"Uber die Formfrage"—to Der Blaue Reiter, in which he argues the parallel between Post-Impressionism and child vision, as exemplified in the work of Henri Rousseau. Certainly Rousseau's vision is childlike. He has had no artistic training and pretends to none. But I consider that his art suffers so greatly from his lack of training, that beyond a sentimental interest it has little to recommend it.<a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The renaissance of the angle in art is an interesting feature of the new movement. Not since Egyptian times has it been used with such noble effect. There is a painting of Gauguin's at Hagen, of a row of Tahitian women seated on a bench, that consists entirely of a telling design in Egyptian angles. Cubism is the result of this discovery of the angle, blended with the influence of Cezanne.<a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Stimmung is almost untranslateable. It is almost “sentiment” in the best sense, and almost “feeling.” Many of Corot’s twilight landscapes are full of a beautiful “stimmung.” Kandinsky uses the word later on to mean the “essential spirit” of nature.⁠—M.T.H.S<a href="chatper-1.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The few solitary exceptions do not destroy the truth of this sad and ominous picture, and even these exceptions are chiefly believers in the doctrine of art for art’s sake. They serve, therefore, a higher ideal, but one which is ultimately a useless waste of their strength. External beauty is one element of a spiritual atmosphere. But beyond this positive fact (that what is beautiful is good) it has the weakness of a talent not used to the full. (The word talent is employed in the biblical sense.)S<a href="chatper-1.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
