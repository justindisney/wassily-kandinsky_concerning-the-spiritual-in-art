					<p>Religion, in the sense of awe, is present in all true art. But here I use the term in the narrower sense to mean pictures of which the subject is connected with Christian or other worship.<a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>I am well aware that this statement is at variance with Kandinsky, who has contributed a long article—"Uber die Formfrage"—to Der Blaue Reiter, in which he argues the parallel between Post-Impressionism and child vision, as exemplified in the work of Henri Rousseau. Certainly Rousseau's vision is childlike. He has had no artistic training and pretends to none. But I consider that his art suffers so greatly from his lack of training, that beyond a sentimental interest it has little to recommend it.<a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The renaissance of the angle in art is an interesting feature of the new movement. Not since Egyptian times has it been used with such noble effect. There is a painting of Gauguin's at Hagen, of a row of Tahitian women seated on a bench, that consists entirely of a telling design in Egyptian angles. Cubism is the result of this discovery of the angle, blended with the influence of Cezanne.<a href="introduction.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Stimmung is almost untranslateable. It is almost “sentiment” in the best sense, and almost “feeling.” Many of Corot’s twilight landscapes are full of a beautiful “stimmung.” Kandinsky uses the word later on to mean the “essential spirit” of nature.⁠—M.T.H.S<a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The few solitary exceptions do not destroy the truth of this sad and ominous picture, and even these exceptions are chiefly believers in the doctrine of art for art’s sake. They serve, therefore, a higher ideal, but one which is ultimately a useless waste of their strength. External beauty is one element of a spiritual atmosphere. But beyond this positive fact (that what is beautiful is good) it has the weakness of a talent not used to the full. (The word talent is employed in the biblical sense.)<a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Weber, composer of Der Freischutz, said of Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony: “The extravagances of genius have reached the limit; Beethoven is now ripe for an asylum.” Of the opening phrase, on a reiterated “e,” the Abbe Stadler said to his neighbour, when first he heard it: “Always that miserable ’e’; he seems to be deaf to it himself, the idiot!”<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Are not many monuments in themselves answers to that question?<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Frequent use is made here of the terms “material” and “non-material,” and of the intermediate phrases “more” or “less material.” Is everything material? or is EVERYTHING spiritual? Can the distinctions we make between matter and spirit be nothing but relative modifications of one or the other? Thought which, although a product of the spirit, can be defined with positive science, is matter, but of fine and not coarse substance. Is whatever cannot be touched with the hand, spiritual? The discussion lies beyond the scope of this little book; all that matters here is that the boundaries drawn should not be too definite.<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Zoller, Wagner, Butleroff (St. Petersburg), Crookes (London), etc.; later on, C. H. Richet, C. Flammarion. The Parisian paper Le Matin, published about two years ago the discoveries of the two last named under the title “Je le constate, mais je ne l’explique pas.” Finally there are C. Lombroso, the inventor of the anthropological method of diagnosing crime, and Eusapio Palladino.<a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Frequently in such cases use is made of the word hypnotism; that same hypnotism which, in its earlier form of mesmerism, was disdainfully put aside by various learned bodies.<a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>To the front rank of such seers of the decadence belongs also Alfred Kubin. With irresistible force both Kubin’s drawings and also his novel “Die Andere Seite” seem to engulf us in the terrible atmosphere of empty desolation.<a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-16" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>When one of Maeterlinck’s plays was produced in St. Petersburg under his own guidance, he himself at one of the rehearsals had a tower represented by a plain piece of hanging linen. It was of no importance to him to have elaborate scenery prepared. He did as children, the greatest imaginers of all time, always do in their games; for they use a stick for a horse or create entire regiments of cavalry out of chalks. And in the same way a chalk with a notch in it is changed from a knight into a horse. On similar lines the imagination of the spectator plays in the modern theatre, and especially in that of Russia, an important part. And this is a notable element in the transition from the material to the spiritual in the theatre of the future.<a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Frequent attempts have shown that such a spiritual atmosphere can belong not only to heroes but to any human being. Sensitives cannot, for example, remain in a room in which a person has been who is spiritually antagonistic to them, even though they know nothing of his existence.<a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
